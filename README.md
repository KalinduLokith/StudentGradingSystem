# StudentGradingSystem
 This program is done to predict progression outcomes at the end of each academic  year


The coursework is divided into four parts, each with specific requirements and objectives. Here is a breakdown of each part:

Part 1: Main Version

The program should allow students to predict their progression outcome based on the number of credits at pass, defer, and fail.
Validation checks should be implemented to ensure the input is correct (e.g., checking for the right data type, credit ranges, and total correctness).
The program should use efficient conditional statements to determine the progression outcome.
Multiple outcomes can be predicted for different students, and a histogram should be generated at the end to display the distribution of progression outcomes.

Part 2: Vertical Histogram (extension)

Extend the program from Part 1 to include a vertical histogram where stars in each category (progress, trailing, retriever, exclude) go downwards.

Part 3: List/Tuple/Directory (extension)

Extend the program further to store the input progression data in a list, tuple, or directory.
Access the stored data and print it in a specific format.

Part 4: Text File

Create an additional program or extend the existing one to save the input progression data to a text file.
Retrieve the data from the file and print it in a specific format.
